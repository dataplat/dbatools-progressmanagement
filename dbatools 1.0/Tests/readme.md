# Tests
Most of the finalization tasks of dbatools occur on a per-function level. They need to be cleaned up, have issues resolved and formatted to a common standard.
The progress in this task is monitored by tests, that will be performed on every single function. This produces a report on the state of dbatools and the progress we make.

Responsible for the planning and implementation of these tests:
Friedrich Weinmann (Fred)

Supervisor for compliance with requirements:
- Community at large
- Chrissy LeMaire in particular
